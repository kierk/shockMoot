## API Integration

This application uses the SwitchBot API v1.1 to send commands to your devices. The app:

- Generates proper HMAC-SHA256 signatures for authentication
- Sends a "press" command with "default" parameter
- Handles API responses and displays success/error messages

## Security Notes

- All credentials are handled client-side only
- No data is stored or transmitted to external servers
- The app uses modern cryptographic APIs for secure authentication
- Toggle visibility for sensitive fields to prevent shoulder surfing

## Browser Compatibility

- Chrome 60+
- Firefox 55+
- Safari 11+
- Edge 79+

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **API Authentication Failed**: Double-check your Secret Key and Open Token
2. **Device Not Found**: Verify your Device ID is correct
3. **CORS Errors**: SwitchBot API doesn't allow direct browser requests. The app includes multiple CORS proxy fallbacks, but if you still encounter issues:

   **Solution 1: Browser Extension**
   - Install "CORS Unblock" or "CORS Everywhere" browser extension
   - Enable it for your domain
   - Refresh the page and try again

   **Solution 2: Alternative Proxies**
   - The app automatically tries multiple CORS proxies
   - If all fail, the error message will suggest using a browser extension

   **Solution 3: Local Development**
   - Run a local server: `python -m http.server 8000`
   - Access via `http://localhost:8000`
   - This bypasses some CORS restrictions

### Getting Help

- Check the [SwitchBot API Documentation](https://github.com/OpenWonderLabs/SwitchBotAPI)
- Verify your credentials in the SwitchBot app
- Ensure your device is online and connected
